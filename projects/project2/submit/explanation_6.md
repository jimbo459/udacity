### Problem 6 - Max and Min in an Unsorted Array

This problem keeps track of the min and max values in a single traversal of a list.
Given that we just need to return these two values there is no need to actually sort the list, 
and can just pass over it once. 
The space complexity is constant as we create no new data structures, other than the return values.

### Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
